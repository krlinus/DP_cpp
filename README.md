My test implementations as Design Patterns code examples

This repo contains, or will contain, trivial examples of design patterns based on my understanding after reading the g4 and other 
text
Examples are in C++, as, IMO, the Java community has already too many resources on these theoritical matters. If I get as good in Python, I might think of putting functional variants here. You are of course, welcome to help
